# Assembly: Endgame

Live Website: [Here](https://assembly-hangman-nu.vercel.app/)

## Introduction üéÆ

Welcome to **Assembly: Endgame**, a unique twist on the classic game of Hangman. In this version, you're tasked with saving the programming world from the dreaded Assembly! Each incorrect guess causes a beloved programming language to "fall," and with each fall, Assembly gets one step closer to taking over. Can you guess the hidden word in time to save all the languages?

## How to Play ü§î

The rules are simple:

1.  A hidden word related to computer science or programming is chosen at random.
2.  Your goal is to guess the word, one letter at a time.
3.  For every incorrect guess, one of the **eight** programming language chips is removed.
4.  If you guess all the letters in the word before all eight languages are gone, you win!
5.  If all eight languages are lost, you lose and Assembly reigns supreme.
